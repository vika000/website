<h1>Input device</h1> <br/>

<p> Keyboard – Every key you press on a keyboard sends a specific input signal to the computer, these are called commands. Commands allow you to open programs, move around screen, type messages, and perform many other functions on your computer. Keyboards are one of the primary input devices used to input data and commands. All keyboards have a typing area with function keys, control keys, arrow keys, keypad and the keyboard itself with the letters, numbers and commands. Keyboards often use the same key for multiple purposes like to type a number or to show different areas on a screen. It is common to switch up a a key’s ­purpose by pressing a separate key first. Instead of a requiring a physical keyboard, users enter data via an on-screen keyboard, or with a virtual keyboard which is a keyboard that projects from a device to a flat surface! I use keyboards all the time and I chose to focus on keyboards as an input device because I find describing mundane thing intersting. <br/>

<h1> Output device </h1><br/>

<p>A Plotter is an output device for a computer. Plotters have the same functionality as traditional printers, generating a hard copy of a digitally depicted images, but instead of using toner, plotters use a pen, pencil, marker or another mark making tool supplied by the user. In order to print your file, you will need to send the file as a vector file. Once the plotter receives the vector file, it uses the vector lines as its instructions on what and where to draw. I chose the plotter as my computer hardware output device because I am interested in generative art, and find the plotter an extremely useful tool in creating. I have been using a combination of Java Script, Processing and a Plotter  to create unique, generative art. <br/>

<h1> Storage device </h1><br/>

<p>
Solid State Drives are a storage medium that uses a non-volatile memory as a mean of holding and accessing vast amounts of data! They are much faster than traditional hard drive, SSD has the advantage of using a NAND flash memory, technology that does not require power in order to retain data. Unlike a hard drive, SSDs have no mechanical moving parts and therefore almost immediate access to data, a noiseless operations and have a lower power consumption. This lack of moving parts makes the SSD a very reliable and robust storage medium and it makes it ideal for portable devices! The downside is the cost, they are much more expensive than traditional hard drives and the life span. Apparently, a solid-state drive works can only sustain a finite number of writes before it dies. I chose SSDs because I am looking to buy a new computer and I found SSDs a relevant and interesting topic.<br/>
