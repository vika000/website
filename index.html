   <h2> About me</h2><br/>
   <p> 
     My name is Vika. I am a visual Artist, so I spend most of my time painting and drawing in my studio. I was born on February 12th, at 9:30pm in a small room at Sunny side hospital. Consequently,
     I am an Aquarius sun, Libra rising and Scorpio moon. Astrology is a very fascinating lens to view the world through and I’ve found myself able to connect with strangers through conversations
     related to the zodiac.<br>
     I studied Video and sound at PNCA and I have been taking classes here at PCC. I found myself drawn to the world of computers through a class entitled “coding for artists.” Ive been coding for a
     couple of years now using the programs Max MSP, Processing and P5.js. I took computer information systems because I wanted to learn more about coding.

   <h2>I like to write</h2><br/>
   <p>
     i am entranced and bound; looking down at my hands like are these things on or what? currently suffering from 'wtf-am-i-doing' syndrome. side effects include; over thinking, lack of sleep,
     excessive journaling, ect. feeling like these past few weeks have been a waste but who needs depression when you have progression.
