     i am entranced and bound; looking down at my hands like are these things on or what? currently suffering from 'wtf-am-i-doing' syndrome. side effects include; over thinking, lack of sleep,
     excessive journaling, ect. feeling like these past few weeks have been a waste but who needs depression when you have progression.
